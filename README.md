# Cat vs Non-Cat Image Classifier

This project showcases a **logistic regression image classifier** built from scratch in Python, designed to distinguish between cat and non-cat images. The implementation follows a neural network mindset, emphasizing core concepts like data preprocessing, parameter initialization, forward and backward propagation, and gradient descent optimization.

## Project Highlights

- **End-to-end implementation:** All steps coded manually using NumPy, from loading and flattening image data to training and evaluating the model. Steps included data-loading, pre-processing, forward & backward propagation, optimizing gradient descent & prediction using the trained model.
- **Educational focus:** Demonstrates understanding of machine learning fundamentals, including activation functions, loss calculation, and model evaluation.

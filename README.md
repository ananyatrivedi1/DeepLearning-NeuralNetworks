# Cat vs Non-Cat Image Classifier

This project showcases a **logistic regression image classifier** built from scratch in Python, designed to distinguish between cat and non-cat images. The implementation follows a neural network mindset, emphasizing core concepts like data preprocessing, parameter initialization, forward and backward propagation, and gradient descent optimization.

## Project Highlights

- **End-to-end implementation:** All steps coded manually using NumPy, from loading and flattening image data to training and evaluating the model.
- **Educational focus:** Demonstrates understanding of machine learning fundamentals, including activation functions, loss calculation, and model evaluation.
- **Portfolio value:** Serves as evidence of hands-on experience with ML workflows, data handling, and algorithmic thinking—key skills for any aspiring machine learning engineer.[^1][^2][^3]


## What This Project Demonstrates

- Ability to work with real-world image data and perform necessary preprocessing.
- Understanding of logistic regression as a foundational classification algorithm.
- Experience implementing the mathematical steps of a neural network (without relying on high-level libraries).
- Skills in evaluating model performance and interpreting results.


## Why Include This in Your Portfolio?

- Shows you can build and explain a classic ML model from the ground up.
- Highlights your grasp of both the theory and practical coding required for machine learning projects.
- Provides a clear, reproducible example of your work for recruiters or collaborators to review.
